### Setup Instructions

1. **Assuming you have already created your sample frontend pages/components (React).**
   
2. **For this demonstration, I will be using an online MySQL database hosted on Aiven:**  
   [Aiven Free MySQL Database](https://aiven.io/free-mysql-database)

3. Create a new directory for your backend code:  
   ```bash
 #  mkdir mybackend
   ```

4. Navigate to the backend directory:  
   ```bash
  # cd mybackend
   ```

5. Install the necessary dependencies:  
   ```bash
  # npm install express apollo-server-express graphql mysql2
   ```

6. Create a `.env` file in the `mybackend` directory.

7. Create an `index.js` file in the `mybackend` directory and input the necessary code (you can modify it to suit your needs).

8. Now that the backend is set up, you can run it in your command line or preferred terminal. Make sure you are in the backend directory, then execute:  
   ```bash
  # node index.js
   ```

9. Navigate to your React frontend project directory and install the Apollo Client:  
   ```bash
  # npm install @apollo/client graphql
   ```

10. In your React project, create a new file named `ApolloProvider.js` in the `src` directory and input the necessary code.

11. Wrap your `src/index.js` or `src/App.js` application with the `ApolloProvider` component. In my case, I will do it in `index.js`.

12. Use `section.jsx` located in `/src/component/section.jsx` to display data from the backend.

13. Finally, start your React application:  
   
    #npm start
