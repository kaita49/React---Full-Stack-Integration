#assuming you ve already created your sample front end page/components(react-tailwind).
#for my demonstration i will be using an online mysql database hosted in aiven "https://aiven.io/free-mysql-database"
# mkdir mybackend(mybackend is directory for my backend code)
#cd homehub-backend 
# npm install express apollo-server-express graphql mysql2
#create.env file in the mybackend directory
#create  "index.js" in the mybackend directory & input the data (you can modify it to suit your case)
#now we are done with the backend, you can set it up to run in the cmd or whichever terminal of your choice(#make sure you in the backend directory then run "node index.js")
#Go to your React frontend project directory
#In your React project, create a new file named "ApolloProvider.js" in the src directory
